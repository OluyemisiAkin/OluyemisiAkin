<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Oluyemisi Akinboboye</h1>
<h3 align="center">A skilled Instrumentation Control and Automation Engineer. I'm on an upskilling journey in Software Quality Assurance with focus on Test Automation.</h3>

- 🔭 I’m currently researching **Test Automation in Safety Systems in Oil & Gas industry**

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Test Automation at Testify Academy**

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **any projects to further hone my testing skills**

- 🤝 I’m looking for **part-time Software QA opportunities including voluntary ones**

- 💬 Ask me about **industrial automation, safety systems, python, javascript, software testing,**

- 📫 How to reach me **oladayo.akinboboye@gmail.com**

- ⚡ Fun fact **last thing i ever though i would own is a dog, now i have 2 dogs, courtesy my spouse!!**

I'm a detail-oriented and self-driven individual. I have experience in requirements writing and auditing. I have strong eye for details and experienced in developing test cases and executing acceptance tests. My testing experience so far have been in a high risk industry where safety is inevitable, and I thus understand strongly why defective software must not be allowed to go into production as the impact could definitely be a loss of life or loss of containment of highly flammable product.
